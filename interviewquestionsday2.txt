1.arrow function

An arrow function is a consis and cleaner way to write functions in JavaScript.
It was introduced in ES6 and is often used because of its simple syntax and the way it handles the this keyword.
Arrow functions do not have their own this, arguments, super, or new.target.
Instead, they inherit this from the surrounding (lexical) scope, which is one of the biggest differences from normal functions.

examples

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = nums.map(n => n * 2);
console.log(doubled); 


const sayHello = () => console.log("Hello!");
sayHello();

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(5, 3));


const numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20];
const result = numbers.filter(n => n > 10);
console.log(result); 



2. Synthetic Event

A Synthetic Event is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event.
It is mainly used in React to make all events work the same way across different browsers.
React creates an object called SyntheticEvent that
normalizes event properties (target, type, bubbles, etc.)
improves performance using event pooling (older versions)
makes events consistent and predictable
To avoid browser compatibility issues
To handle events the same way on all browsers
To improve performance by managing events efficiently
To use one unified event system

example :
function App() {
  const handleClick = (event) => {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
    console.log("Synthetic Event object:", event);
    console.log("Native Event object:", event.nativeEvent); 
  };
  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
}
export default App;

3.callback
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
It allows one function to run after another function has finished its execution.
Callbacks are used when:
you want to run code later
you want to handle asynchronous operations (API calls, file read, timers)
you want to avoid repeating logic

example:

function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
  callback();
}

function sayBye() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("Satish", sayBye);


console.log ("callback")
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);



4.Callback Hell
Callback Hell is a situation in JavaScript where too many nested callbacks make the code look messy,
hard to read, and difficult to maintain. This usually happens in asynchronous operations when callbacks are written inside other callbacks.

 example :
 setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("first prints");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("secand prints");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("third prints");
    }, 1000);
  }, 2000);
}, 3000);


5. ES6
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is a major update to JavaScript that introduced modern syntax and
 features to make the language more powerful,cleaner, and easier to write.
It added improvements like let/const, arrow functions, classes, promises, modules, and many more.

Features:
5.1 let and const (Block-scoped variables)
let → can be updated
const → cannot be reassigned
Both are block scoped, unlike var.

Example:
let num = 10;
const PI = 3.14;

5.2 Arrow Functions
Shorter function syntax with lexical this.
Example:
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

5.3 Template Literals
Used for easy string formatting & multiline strings.
Example:
const name = "Santhu";
console.log(`Welcome, ${name}`);

5.4 Default Parameters
Set a default value when no argument is passed.
Example:
function greet(name = "Guest") {
  console.log("Hello", name);
}

5.5 Spread Operator (...)
Expands arrays or objects.
Example:
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const copy = [...nums];

5.6 Rest Parameters
Combines multiple arguments into one array. 
Example:
function sum(...numbers) {
  console.log(numbers);
}
sum(1, 2, 3);

5.7 Destructuring (Array & Object)
Extract values easily.
Example:
const person = { name: "satish", age: 22 };
const { name, age } = person;


6. Promise
A Promise is an object in JavaScript that represents the result of an asynchronous operation.
It has three states:
Pending – operation is in progress
resolve – operation completed successfully
Rejected – operation failed
A promise allows you to run code after an async task finishes using then(), catch(), and finally().

example:
function promise() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const success = true;

      if (success) {
        resolve("Data fetched successfully!");
      } else {
        reject("Error fetching data");
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

promise()
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));

What is async/await 
async/await is a cleaner and more readable way to work with Promises.
async → makes a function return a Promise
await → pauses the code until the Promise resolves
It makes asynchronous code look like synchronous code.

example:
function async() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched successfully!");
    }, 2000);
  });
}
async function showData() {
  console.log("hello.");
  const result = await fetchData(); 
  console.log(result);
}
showData();

7. DOM
DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML.
It represents the entire webpage as a tree of objects, where every element (like <div>, <p>, <button>, etc.) 
becomes a node that JavaScript can access and modify.
Because it lets JavaScript:
Change text
Change CSS styles
Add or remove HTML elements
Handle user actions (click, input, submit, etc.)
Function :
document.getElementById()
Finds an element using its id.

Example:
document.querySelectorAll("p").forEach(p => {
  p.style.color = "blue";
});

document.createElement()
Creates new HTML elements dynamically.
Example:
const btn = document.createElement("button");
btn.innerText = "Click Me";
document.body.appendChild(btn);

appendChild()
Adds a new child element into the DOM.
document.body.appendChild(btn);

remove()
Removes an element from the DOM.
document.getElementById("msg").remove();

addEventListener()
Used to handle user actions like click, input, etc.
Example:
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});

innerText / innerHTML (Content Update)
document.getElementById("msg").innerText = "Updated text";
document.getElementById("msg").innerHTML = "<b>Bold text</b>";


8. Refactor a JS program using closures to avoid undefined output.
Here's an example of refactoring a program using closures to avoid undefined output:
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return function() {
        return ++count;
    };
}
const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); 
console.log(counter()); 
console.log(counter()); 


9. Write a program to remove duplicates from a list.
function removeDuplicates(arr) {
    return [...new Set(arr)];
}
const list = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5];
const uniqueList = removeDuplicates(list);
console.log(uniqueList);  


10.Display data in the console from an API.
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
